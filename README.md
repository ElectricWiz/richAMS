You have to have installed the geant4 toolkit to compile this program, and possibly to run it, this is a simulation of the rich detector aboard the AMS-02 experiment, I have included in the build folder some .png's showcasing the detector geometry one macro and an executable, that, hopefully anybody can run it on the computer.
you: just have to write in the console "./sim vis.mac"
